We've reached the first milestone on Project Alpha. Here's a quick update on our progress.

## What we shipped

The core workflow engine is now functional. Teams can define multi-step processes and automate transitions between stages.

## Key decisions

- **Simplicity over features**: We chose a minimal configuration format over a visual builder. Less is more.
- **Local-first**: All processing happens locally. No data leaves your machine unless you explicitly share it.

## What's next

We're focusing on integrations and testing with real-world workflows. Stay tuned for the beta release.
